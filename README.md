# OFFLINE – Digital Addiction Awareness Campaign

**Graduation Project – Graphic Design Track**

---

## 1. Project Introduction
**Offline** is a social awareness campaign addressing the growing issue of digital addiction and the psychological impact of excessive social media usage.

With the increasing dependence on smartphones and digital platforms, individuals—especially young adults—are experiencing higher levels of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and social isolation. The campaign aims to visually communicate the importance of disconnecting from the digital world and reconnecting with real-life experiences to restore balance and improve mental well-being.

Offline is designed as a comprehensive visual communication project that combines branding, print design, social media systems, and interactive awareness concepts to deliver a strong and impactful message.

## 2. Problem Statement
The rapid evolution of social media platforms has transformed daily life into a continuous digital experience. While technology provides convenience and connectivity, excessive usage has led to:

- Reduced face-to-face interaction
